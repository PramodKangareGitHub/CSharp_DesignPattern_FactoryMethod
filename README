# Factory Method Design Pattern

The Factory Method Design Pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

## The Factory Method Design Pattern consists of the following components

- `Product:` This is the interface or abstract class defining the product the factory method will create.
- `ConcreteProduct:` These are the specific implementations of the Product interface or abstract class.
- `Creator:` This abstract class or interface declares the FactoryMethod().
- `ConcreteCreator:` Subclasses of Creator that implement the FactoryMethod() to produce ConcreteProduct instances.
